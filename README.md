# Top-k densest overlapping subgraphs
A Kotlin implementation of the paper "Top-k overlapping densest subgraphs" by Esther Galbrun, Aristides Gionis and Nikolaj Tatti

The current goal for this project is not to achieve maximum efficiency, but to have a stable and comprehensible library that will act as a ground truth for a future C++ implementation.
